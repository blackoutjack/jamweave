JAM microbenchmark tests
=========================

To create a new test, add these files:

  TEST.js: the input program
  TEST.exp.js: the expected output program with abstraction refinement
  TEST.norefine.exp.js: expected output without refinement
  TEST.policy: the input policy (optional; defaults to `simple.policy')

If you don't wish to construct TEST.exp.js by hand,
you can copy output/TEST-0/TEST-collapsed.js after a successful run.

To run all the tests, invoke the tests/run.py script as follows.

$JAMPKG/tests/run.py -m
