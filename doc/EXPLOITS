This document contains information about the types of exploits that JAM
is suited to prevent, and those that it is not able to handle in a
practical manner.

JAM can prevent a given codebase from exhibiting particular behaviors.

Given the current deployment strategy and high overhead cost, JAM is
poorly suited to be applied to highly dynamic websites with constantly
changing, user-driven content.

See README files in the exploits/ subdirectories in the jamtests
repository (https://github.com/blackoutjack/jamtests) for details on
individual exploits.
